# Text Sort Program

This program is a simple version of sorting utility in the Unix operating system. The program can be run from Terminal using the commands: `./textsort filename` or `./textsort -2 filename`. "Filename" is the name of file that contains the text being sorted, and "-2" is an optinal argument that sorts the program based on the 2nd word rather than the first word. Here are some example outputs of the program, as one text file is sorted by 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. word:
