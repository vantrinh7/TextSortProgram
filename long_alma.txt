Alma Mater
Oh Mount Holyoke we pay thee devotion
In the fervour of youth that is strong
The courage of right is thy garland
Our lives alma mater thy song
So from East and from west now we gather
And united in firm love to thee
All years are as one and their loyal pledge
Mount Holyoke forever shall be
Mount Holyoke forever shall be

Thro the heart of a new day s endeavour
Breathes the life of the old days that live
For what thou hast given we honour
But we love thee for what we can give
So when soft in a whisper thou callest
For the treasures unlocked by thy key
Our achievements our hopes and our glorious faith
Shall answer Mount Holyoke to thee 
Shall answer Mount Holyoke to thee

Anti Alma Mater
Oh Mount Holyoke we pay thee tuition
In the fervour of youth that s gone wrong 
Each year it gets higher and higher 
My God alma mater how long 
So from barroom to bedroom we stagger 
And united in free love for all
Our drinks are too strong and our morals gone 
Mount Holyoke what s happening to me
Mount Holyoke what s happening to me

Through the heart of a new night of papers 
Breathes the scent of a dinner that died 
For what we have written we re thankful 
But we wish that our brains were not fried 
So when soft in the east the sun rises 
And we realize that we re out of time 
To classes we run swearing once again 
Earlier next time you ll see
Yes earlier, next time you'll see
